** TODO Pass around `Set` internally? (instead of `NodeList`)
   `.querySelectorAll()` returns a `NodeList` object (which is then used
   internally by Elemental), but MDN seem to think that this is not best
   practice for newer code.
   (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList)

   How about using a Javascript `Set` instead? (Using `new Set($(SELECTOR))`
   seems to work just fine). This would:

   + Automatically uniquify the result (just like jQuery).
   + Maybe make it possible replace some Elemental methods with builtin `Set`
     methods?

** DONE Fixed `.append(HTML)` failure with `<head>` tags                :BUG:
   CLOSED: [2025-03-17 Mon 15:35]
   HTML tags that go into the `<head>` of a document couldn't be added using
   Elemental. This happened since only the `<body>` part of whatever
   `DOMParser().parseFromString()` generated was extracted and inserted.
